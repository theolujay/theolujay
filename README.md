Backend engineer who cares about **reducing manual pain**, shipping APIs that scale, and surfacing insight so systems don’t surprise you.  
I work with Python, containers, observability, and infrastructure — all to make backend engineering less fragile.

### Current Work

**Backend Engineer & Tech Lead – Verboheit**  
- Automated exam workflows and results publication to remove hands-on dependencies on Excel, Docs, and Forms.  
- Deployed services with Docker, routing via Traefik for load balancing, DNS, and API gateway duties.  
- Set up observability stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Prometheus) instrumented with OpenTelemetry; use logs and traces to begin spotting performance issues.

### Highlighted Projects

- **[Paystack API Wrapper](https://github.com/theolujay/paystack-api-wrapper)**  
  Modern Python SDK covering the full Paystack API. Built with tests (~99% coverage), maintained to avoid pitfalls in older libraries.

- **[Grateful For API](https://github.com/theolujay/grateful_for)**  
  A journaling backend I built solo—OAuth2, JWT, feed logic, analytics. Designed to plug in with a frontend later.

- **[VMLC API](https://github.com/theolujay/vmlc_api)**  
  Backend for math-competition platform: candidate registration, exam scoring, leaderboard. Dockerized, versioned, built to handle public traffic (300+ users).
